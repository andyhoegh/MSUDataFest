## ASA DataFest at MSU

DataFest is a 48-hour data science celebration organized by the American Statistical Association. DataFest originated in 2011 and has since spread to over 50 locations, including Montana State University in 2018. 

The data set is unveiled on Friday evening and teams of students analyze the data and present their findings to a panel of judges on Sunday. Additional details about DataFest can be found on the [ASA website](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/).
